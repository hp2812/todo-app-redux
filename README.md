# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- <h1> In this to do app I learn about some fundementals of the redux </h1>
<h2>first we  have to create the srore and add the configurestore  in the store and  then import all the reducer in it or most important there is only one store in it </h2>
<h2>Then we create the slice i feature  and creating the slicer function in slicer function which is object and  name , initialstate  and the reducers(which is method)</h2>
